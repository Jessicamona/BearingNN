# BearingNN
A neural network implementation using nolearn to detect compound fault in a roller bearing with accelerometer data.

This dataset was obtained from case western reserve university data center for bearing data.

Contains mixed fault data on inner race, outer race and non faulty data.

nntest5.py - Neural Network to detect compound fault in the given accelerometer data.

countv3.py - Plots graph to show faults on bearing and write the result to an output file.

u0 - u5 - contains testing data for various races.

op0 - op5 - contains output labels for each of the corresponding testcases.
